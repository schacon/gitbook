## Glossary ##

Here we have the meanings of some terms used into Git context.  
These terms were entirely copied from 
[Git Glossary](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitglossary.html).  


_alternate object database_

>   Via the alternates mechanism, a repository
>   can inherit part of its object database
>   from another object database, which is called "alternate". 

_bare repository_

>   A bare repository is normally an appropriately
>   named directory with a `.git` suffix that does not
>   have a locally checked-out copy of any of the files under
>   revision control. That is, all of the `git`
>   administrative and control files that would normally be present in the
>   hidden `.git` sub-directory are directly present in the
>   `repository.git` directory instead,
>   and no other files are present and checked out. Usually publishers of
>   public repositories make bare repositories available.

_blob object_

>   Untyped object, e.g. the contents of a file.

_branch_

>   A "branch" is an active line of development.  The most recent
>   commit on a branch is referred to as the tip of
>   that branch.  The tip of the branch is referenced by a branch
>   head, which moves forward as additional development
>   is done on the branch.  A single git
>   repository can track an arbitrary number of
>   branches, but your working tree is
>   associated with just one of them (the "current" or "checked out"
>   branch), and HEAD points to that branch.

_cache_

>   Obsolete for: index.

_chain_

>   A list of objects, where each object in the list contains
>   a reference to its successor (for example, the successor of a
>   commit could be one of its parents).

_changeset_

>   BitKeeper/cvsps speak for "commit". Since git does not
>   store changes, but states, it really does not make sense to use the term
>   "changesets" with git.

_checkout_

>   The action of updating all or part of the
>   working tree with a tree object
>   or blob from the
>   object database, and updating the
>   index and HEAD if the whole working tree has
>   been pointed at a new branch.

_cherry-picking_

>   In SCM jargon, "cherry pick" means to choose a subset of
>   changes out of a series of changes (typically commits) and record them
>   as a new series of changes on top of a different codebase. In GIT, this is
>   performed by the "git cherry-pick" command to extract the change introduced
>   by an existing commit and to record it based on the tip
>   of the current branch as a new commit.

_clean_

>   A working tree is clean, if it
>   corresponds to the revision referenced by the current
>   head. Also see "dirty".

_commit_

>   As a noun: A single point in the
>   git history; the entire history of a project is represented as a
>   set of interrelated commits.  The word "commit" is often
>   used by git in the same places other revision control systems
>   use the words "revision" or "version".  Also used as a short
>   hand for commit object.

>   As a verb: The action of storing a new snapshot of the project's
>   state in the git history, by creating a new commit representing the current
>   state of the index and advancing HEAD
>   to point at the new commit.

_commit object_

>   An object which contains the information about a
>   particular revision, such as parents, committer,
>   author, date and the tree object which corresponds
>   to the top directory of the stored
>   revision.

_core git_

>   Fundamental data structures and utilities of git. Exposes only limited
>   source code management tools.

_DAG_

>   Directed acyclic graph. The commit objects form a
>   directed acyclic graph, because they have parents (directed), and the
>   graph of commit objects is acyclic (there is no chain
>   which begins and ends with the same object).

_dangling object_

>   An unreachable object which is not
>   reachable even from other unreachable objects; a
>   dangling object has no references to it from any
>   reference or object in the repository.

_detached HEAD_

>   Normally the HEAD stores the name of a
>   branch.  However, git also allows you to check out
>   an arbitrary commit that isn't necessarily the tip of any
>   particular branch.  In this case HEAD is said to be "detached".

_dircache_

>   You are *waaaaay* behind. See index.

_directory_

>   The list you get with "ls" :-)

_dirty_

>   A working tree is said to be "dirty" if
>   it contains modifications which have not been committed to the current
>   branch.

_ent_

>   Favorite synonym to "tree-ish" by some total geeks. See
>   `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ent_(Middle-earth)` for an in-depth
>   explanation. Avoid this term, not to confuse people.

_evil merge_

>   An evil merge is a merge that introduces changes that
>   do not appear in any parent.

_fast forward_

>   A fast-forward is a special type of merge where you have a
>   revision and you are "merging" another
>   branch's changes that happen to be a descendant of what
>   you have. In such these cases, you do not make a new merge
>   commit but instead just update to his
>   revision. This will happen frequently on a
>   tracking branch of a remote
>   repository.

_fetch_

>   Fetching a branch means to get the
>   branch's head ref from a remote
>   repository, to find out which objects are
>   missing from the local object database,
>   and to get them, too.  See also linkgit:git-fetch[1].

_file system_

>   Linus Torvalds originally designed git to be a user space file system,
>   i.e. the infrastructure to hold files and directories. That ensured the
>   efficiency and speed of git.

_git archive_

>   Synonym for repository (for arch people).

_grafts_

>   Grafts enables two otherwise different lines of development to be joined
>   together by recording fake ancestry information for commits. This way
>   you can make git pretend the set of parents a commit has
>   is different from what was recorded when the commit was
>   created. Configured via the `.git/info/grafts` file.

_hash_

>   In git's context, synonym to object name.

_head_

>   A named reference to the commit at the tip of a
>   branch.  Heads are stored in
>   `$GIT_DIR/refs/heads/`, except when using packed refs. (See
>   linkgit:git-pack-refs[1].)

_HEAD_

>   The current branch.  In more detail: Your working tree is normally derived 
>   from the state of the tree referred to by HEAD.  HEAD is a reference to one
>   of the heads in your repository, except when using a detached HEAD, in which
>   case it may	reference an arbitrary commit.

_head ref_

>   A synonym for head.

_hook_

>   During the normal execution of several git commands, call-outs are made
>   to optional scripts that allow a developer to add functionality or
>   checking. Typically, the hooks allow for a command to be pre-verified
>   and potentially aborted, and allow for a post-notification after the
>   operation is done. The hook scripts are found in the
>   `$GIT_DIR/hooks/` directory, and are enabled by simply
>   removing the `.sample` suffix from the filename. In earlier versions
>   of git you had to make them executable.

_index_

>   A collection of files with stat information, whose contents are stored
>   as objects. The index is a stored version of your
>   working tree. Truth be told, it can also contain a second, and even
>   a third version of a working tree, which are used
>   when merging.

_index entry_

>   The information regarding a particular file, stored in the
>   index. An index entry can be unmerged, if a
>   merge was started, but not yet finished (i.e. if
>   the index contains multiple versions of that file).

_master_

>   The default development branch. Whenever you
>   create a git repository, a branch named
>   "master" is created, and becomes the active branch. In most
>   cases, this contains the local development, though that is
>   purely by convention and is not required.

_merge_

>   As a verb: To bring the contents of another
>   branch (possibly from an external
>   repository) into the current branch.  In the
>   case where the merged-in branch is from a different repository,
>   this is done by first fetching the remote branch
>   and then merging the result into the current branch.  This
>   combination of fetch and merge operations is called a
>   pull.  Merging is performed by an automatic process
>   that identifies changes made since the branches diverged, and
>   then applies all those changes together.  In cases where changes
>   conflict, manual intervention may be required to complete the
>   merge.

>   As a noun: unless it is a fast forward, a
>   successful merge results in the creation of a new commit
>   representing the result of the merge, and having as
>   parents the tips of the merged branches.
>   This commit is referred to as a "merge commit", or sometimes just a
>   "merge".

_object_

>   The unit of storage in git. It is uniquely identified by the
>   SHA1 of its contents. Consequently, an
>   object can not be changed.

_object database_

>   Stores a set of "objects", and an individual object is
>   identified by its object name. The objects usually
>   live in `$GIT_DIR/objects/`.

_object identifier_

>   Synonym for object name.

_object name_

>   The unique identifier of an object. The hash
>   of the object's contents using the Secure Hash Algorithm
>   1 and usually represented by the 40 character hexadecimal encoding of
>   the hash of the object.

_object type_

>   One of the identifiers "commit", "tree", "tag" or "blob" describing the 
>   type of an object.

_octopus_

>   To merge more than two branches. Also denotes an
>   intelligent predator.

_origin_

>   The default upstream repository. Most projects have
>   at least one upstream project which they track. By default
>   'origin' is used for that purpose. New upstream updates
>   will be fetched into remote tracking branches named
>   origin/name-of-upstream-branch, which you can see using
>   "`git branch -r`".

_pack_

>   A set of objects which have been compressed into one file (to save space
>   or to transmit them efficiently).

_pack index_

>   The list of identifiers, and other information, of the objects in a
>   pack, to assist in efficiently accessing the contents of a
>   pack.

_parent_

>   A commit object contains a (possibly empty) list
>   of the logical predecessor(s) in the line of development, i.e. its
>   parents.

_pickaxe_

>   The term pickaxe refers to an option to the diffcore
>   routines that help select changes that add or delete a given text
>   string. With the `--pickaxe-all` option, it can be used to view the full
>   changeset that introduced or removed, say, a
>   particular line of text. See linkgit:git-diff[1].

_plumbing_

>   Cute name for core git.

_porcelain_

>   Cute name for programs and program suites depending on
>   core git, presenting a high level access to
>   core git. Porcelains expose more of a SCM
>   interface than the plumbing.

_pull_

>   Pulling a branch means to fetch it and
>   merge it.  See also linkgit:git-pull[1].

_push_

>   Pushing a branch means to get the branch's
>   head ref from a remote repository,
>   find out if it is a direct ancestor to the branch's local
>   head ref, and in that case, putting all
>   objects, which are reachable from the local
>   head ref, and which are missing from the remote
>   repository, into the remote
>   object database, and updating the remote
>   head ref. If the remote head is not an
>   ancestor to the local head, the push fails.

_reachable_

>   All of the ancestors of a given commit are said to be
>   "reachable" from that commit. More
>   generally, one object is reachable from
>   another if we can reach the one from the other by a chain
>   that follows tags to whatever they tag,
>   commits to their parents or trees, and
>   trees to the trees or blobs
>   that they contain.

_rebase_

>   To reapply a series of changes from a branch to a
>   different base, and reset the head of that branch
>   to the result.

_ref_

>   A 40-byte hex representation of a SHA1 or a name that
>   denotes a particular object. These may be stored in
>   `$GIT_DIR/refs/`.

_reflog_

>   A reflog shows the local "history" of a ref.  In other words,
>   it can tell you what the 3rd last revision in _this_ repository
>   was, and what was the current state in _this_ repository,
>   yesterday 9:14pm.  See linkgit:git-reflog[1] for details.

_refspec_

>   A "refspec" is used by fetch and
>   push to describe the mapping between remote
>   ref and local ref. They are combined with a colon in
>   the format <src>:<dst>, preceded by an optional plus sign, +.
>   For example: `git fetch $URL
>   refs/heads/master:refs/heads/origin` means "grab the master
>   branch head from the $URL and store
>   it as my origin branch head". And `git push
>   $URL refs/heads/master:refs/heads/to-upstream` means "publish my
>   master branch head as to-upstream branch at $URL". See also
>   linkgit:git-push[1].

_repository_

>   A collection of refs together with an
>   object database containing all objects
>   which are reachable from the refs, possibly
>   accompanied by meta data from one or more porcelains. A
>   repository can share an object database with other repositories
>   via alternates mechanism.

_resolve_

>   The action of fixing up manually what a failed automatic
>   merge left behind.

_revision_

>   A particular state of files and directories which was stored in the
>   object database. It is referenced by a
>   commit object.

_rewind_

>   To throw away part of the development, i.e. to assign the
>   head to an earlier revision.

_SCM_

>   Source code management (tool).

_SHA1_

>   Synonym for object name.

_shallow repository_

>   A shallow repository has an incomplete
>   history some of whose commits have parents cauterized away (in other
>   words, git is told to pretend that these commits do not have the
>   parents, even though they are recorded in the commit
>   object). This is sometimes useful when you are interested only in the
>   recent history of a project even though the real history recorded in the
>   upstream is much larger. A shallow repository
>   is created by giving the `--depth` option to linkgit:git-clone[1], and
>   its history can be later deepened with linkgit:git-fetch[1].

_symref_

>   Symbolic reference: instead of containing the SHA1
>   id itself, it is of the format 'ref: refs/some/thing' and when
>   referenced, it recursively dereferences to this reference.
>   'HEAD' is a prime example of a symref. Symbolic
>   references are manipulated with the linkgit:git-symbolic-ref[1]
>   command.

_tag_

>   A ref pointing to a tag or
>   commit object. In contrast to a head,
>   a tag is not changed by a commit. Tags (not
>   tag objects) are stored in `$GIT_DIR/refs/tags/`. A
>   git tag has nothing to do with a Lisp tag (which would be
>   called an object type in git's context). A
>   tag is most typically used to mark a particular point in the
>   commit ancestry chain.

_tag object_

>   An object containing a ref pointing to
>   another object, which can contain a message just like a
>   commit object. It can also contain a (PGP)
>   signature, in which case it is called a "signed tag object".

_topic branch_

>   A regular git branch that is used by a developer to
>   identify a conceptual line of development. Since branches are very easy
>   and inexpensive, it is often desirable to have several small branches
>   that each contain very well defined concepts or small incremental yet
>   related changes.

_tracking branch_

>   A regular git branch that is used to follow changes from
>   another repository. A tracking
>   branch should not contain direct modifications or have local commits
>   made to it. A tracking branch can usually be
>   identified as the right-hand-side ref in a Pull:
>   refspec.

_tree_

>   Either a working tree, or a tree object together with the dependent 
>   blob and tree objects (i.e. a stored representation of a working tree).

_tree object_

>   An object containing a list of file names and modes along
>   with refs to the associated blob and/or tree objects. A
>   tree is equivalent to a directory.

_tree-ish_

>   A ref pointing to either a commit object, a tree object, or a tag
>   object pointing to a tag or commit or tree object.

_unmerged index_

>   An index which contains unmerged
>   index entries.

_unreachable object_

>   An object which is not reachable from a
>   branch, tag, or any other reference.

_working tree_

>   The tree of actual checked out files.  The working tree is
>   normally equal to the HEAD plus any local changes
>   that you have made but not yet committed.
