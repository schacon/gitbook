## Git on Windows ##

(also mSysGit)

Git provides a convenient Windows installer with mingw and bash, plus some shell integration facilities.
Be aware of newline issues when working across platforms (consider setting core.autocrlf to 'input' or 'true');
otherwise, Git works the same way on Windows as it does anywhere else.
