## The Packfile ##

This chapter explains in detail, down to the bits, how the packfile and 
pack index files are formatted.

### The Packfile Index ###

First off, we have the packfile index, which is basically just a series of 
bookmarks into a packfile. 

There are two versions of the packfile index - version one, which is the default
in versions of Git earlier than 1.6, and version two, which is the default
from 1.6 forward, but which can be read by Git versions going back to 1.5.2, and
has been further backported to 1.4.4.5 if you are still on the 1.4 series.

Version 2 also includes a CRC checksum of each object so compressed data 
can be copied directly from pack to pack during repacking without 
undetected data corruption.  Version 2 indexes can also handle packfiles
larger than 4 Gb.

In both formats, the fanout table is simply a way to find the offset of a
particular sha faster within the index file.  The offset/sha1[]
tables are sorted by sha1[] values (this is to allow binary search of this
table), and fanout[] table points at the offset/sha1[] table in a specific
way (so that part of the latter table that covers all hashes that start
with a given byte can be found to avoid 8 iterations of the binary
search).

In version 1, the offsets and shas are in the same space, where in version two, 
there are separate tables
for the shas, crc checksums and offsets.  At the end of both files are 
checksum shas for both the index file and the packfile it references.

Importantly, packfile indexes are *not* neccesary to extract objects from
a packfile, they are simply used to *quickly* retrieve individual objects from
a pack.  The packfile format is used in upload-pack and receieve-pack programs
(push and fetch protocols) to transfer objects and there is no index used then
- it can be built after the fact by scanning the packfile.

### The Packfile Format ###

The packfile itself is a very simple format.  There is a header, a series of
packed objects (each with it's own header and body) and then a checksum trailer.
The first four bytes is the string 'PACK', which is sort of used to make sure 
you're getting the start of the packfile correctly.  This is followed by a 4-byte
packfile version number and then a 4-byte number of entries in that file.  In
Ruby, you might read the header data like this:

	ruby
	def read_pack_header
	  sig = @session.recv(4)
	  ver = @session.recv(4).unpack("N")[0]
	  entries = @session.recv(4).unpack("N")[0]
	  [sig, ver, entries]
	end

After that, you get a series of packed objects, in order of thier SHAs
which each consist of an object header and object contents.  At the end
of the packfile is a 20-byte SHA1 sum of all the shas (in sorted order) in that
packfile.

The object header is a series of one or more 1 byte (8 bit) hunks that
specify the type of object the following data is, and the size of the data
when expanded.  Each byte is really 7 bits of data, with the first bit being
used to say if that hunk is the last one or not before the data starts.  If
the first bit is a 1, you will read another byte, otherwise the data starts
next.  The first 3 bits in the first byte specifies the type of data, 
according to the table below. 

(Currently, of the 8 values that can be expressed
with 3 bits (0-7), 0 (000) is 'undefined' and 5 (101) is not yet used.)

Here, we can see an example of a header of two bytes, where the first
specifies that the following data is a commit, and the remainder of the first
and the last 7 bits of the second specifies that the data will be 144 bytes
when expanded.

[fig:packfile-logic]

It is important to note that the size specified in the header data is not 
the size of the data that actually follows, but the size of that data *when 
expanded*. This is why the offsets in the packfile index are so useful, 
otherwise you have to expand every object just to tell when the next header 
starts.

The data part is just zlib stream for non-delta object types; for the two
delta object representations, the data portion contains something that
identifies which base object this delta representation depends on, and the
delta to apply on the base object to resurrect this object.  <code>ref-delta</code>
uses 20-byte hash of the base object at the beginning of data, while
<code>ofs-delta</code> stores an offset within the same packfile to identify the base
object.  In either case, two important constraints a reimplementor must
adhere to are:

* delta representation must be based on some other object within the same
  packfile;

* the base object must be of the same underlying type (blob, tree, commit
  or tag);
