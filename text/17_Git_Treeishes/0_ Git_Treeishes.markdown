## Git Treeishes ##

There are a number of ways to refer to a particular commit or tree other
than spelling out the entire 40-character sha.  In Git, these are referred
to as a 'treeish'.

### Partial Sha ###

If your commit sha is '<code>980e3ccdaac54a0d4de358f3fe5d718027d96aae</code>', git will 
recognize any of the following identically:

	980e3ccdaac54a0d4de358f3fe5d718027d96aae
	980e3ccdaac54a0d4
	980e3cc

As long as the partial sha is unique - it can't be confused with another
(which is incredibly unlikely if you use at least 5 characters), git will
expand a partial sha for you.

### Branch, Remote or Tag Name ###

You can always use a branch, remote or tag name instead of a sha, since they
are simply pointers anyhow.  If your master branch is on the 980e3 commit and
you've pushed it to origin and have tagged it 'v1.0', then all of the following
are equivalent:

	980e3ccdaac54a0d4de358f3fe5d718027d96aae
	origin/master
	refs/remotes/origin/master
	master
	refs/heads/master
	v1.0
	refs/tags/v1.0
	
Which means the following will give you identical output:

	$ git log master
	
	$ git log refs/tags/v1.0
	
### Date Spec ###

The Ref Log that git keeps will allow you to do some relative stuff locally, 
such as: 

	master@{yesterday}

	master@{1 month ago}
	
Which is shorthand for 'where the master branch head was yesterday', etc. Note
that this format can result in different shas on different computers, even if
the master branch is currently pointing to the same place.

### Ordinal Spec ###

This format will give you the Nth previous value of a particular reference.
For example:

	master@{5}

will give you the 5th prior value of the master head ref.
	
### Caret Parent ###

This will give you the Nth parent of a particular commit.  This format is only
useful on merge commits - commit objects that have more than one direct parent.

	master^2
	
	
### Tilde Spec ###

The tilde spec will give you the Nth grandparent of a commit object.  For example,

	master~2
	
will give us the first parent of the first parent of the commit that master 
points to.  It is equivalent to:

	master^^

You can keep doing this, too.  The following specs will point to the same commit:

	master^^^^^^
	master~3^~2
	master~6

### Tree Pointer ###

This disambiguates a commit from the tree that it points to.  If you want the 
sha that a commit points to, you can add the '^{tree}' spec to the end of it.

	master^{tree}

### Blob Spec ###

If you want the sha of a particular blob, you can add the blob path at the
end of the treeish, like so:

	master:/path/to/file
	
### Range ###

Finally, you can specify a range of commits with the range spec.  This will
give you all the commits between 7b593b5 and 51bea1 (where 51bea1 is most recent),
excluding 7b593b5 but including 51bea1:

	7b593b5..51bea1

This will include every commit *since* 7b593b:

	7b593b..
